# Pipes of Haunting
_Wondrous item (musical instrument), uncommon_  

You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 [charges](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Magic%20Items?expansion=34047#toc_9). You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 [[Spells/Saving throws/Wisdom saving throw]] or become [frightened](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=34047#toc_4) of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
